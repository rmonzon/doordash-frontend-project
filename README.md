# DoorDash Frontend Interview Project

## Steps to run the project locally
By this time you should have this project cloned in your computer, what you need to do to run it locally 
is pretty simple.

### 1. Installing dependencies
Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. I used yarn instead of npm but if you're not
a fan a yarn yet, npm does the job as well.

Now run `yarn` or `npm i` in this repo to get your dependencies.

### 2. Serving the app
By default, you can run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run your app, I used Webpack dev server for building purposes.
You'll notice this in package.json on the scripts section.

### 3. Running the api server
Same way you provided it to me. `yarn run api-server` or `npm run api-server`

### 4. You're good to go!
By this step you should have the project running locally and ready to be tested.

## Important things to point out
Tools I used on this project:

- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- Babel
- SASS
- postCSS
- Yarn

I made several changes to the original designs in order to have a better UI/UX. I have a bunch of other ideas 
to improve even more the experience that unfortunately could'nt do due to time constraints, I guess if we meet
in person you'll find out :wink:

Again there's quite a few things that can be improved and refactored.
